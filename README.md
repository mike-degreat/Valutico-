WEB DEVELOPMENT ASSIGNMENT
Good evening, @everyone . I trust we are all enjoying our weekend. Our next assignment is here and what we would be doing is that we would be replicating a simple landing page in a Figma file. 

This task would involve you using everything you have learnt in the past few weeks to get it done. The task will be done with whatever IDE you like and you will push it to GitHub. 

The assignment submission would require only your GitHub link.

The Deadline for this is Monday, 15th May by 3PM.
